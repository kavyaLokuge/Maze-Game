# Maze Game

This is a simple Maze-Game that uses JavaScript, SCSS, and HTML to create a basic game where the player needs to navigate through a maze to reach the end. The player will use the arrow keys to move the character through the maze.

### How to Play:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
Use the arrow keys to move the character through the maze.
Reach the finish line to win the game.

### Technologies Used:

JavaScript
SCSS
HTML

### Code Structure:

The game consists of an HTML file that includes a container div that holds the game board, a character div that represents the player, and a finish line div that represents the end of the maze. The SCSS file is used to style the game board, character, and finish line. The JavaScript file handles the movement of the character and checks if the player has reached the end of the maze.
